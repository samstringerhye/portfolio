## The Challenge

Samsung wanted to bring the hands-on experience of in-store appliance customization to an online platform. In physical stores, customers could see appliance finishes and configurations firsthand, helping them make confident decisions. The goal was to replicate this experience digitally while maintaining the same level of clarity and interactivity.

Achieving this required an intuitive, engaging interface that made customization easy without overwhelming users. I worked closely with UX researchers, engineers, and stakeholders to create a strategy that prioritized simplicity and usability, ensuring a seamless and informative customization journey.
