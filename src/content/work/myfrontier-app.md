The MyFrontier app was overdue for a refresh to improve usability and align with Frontier's modernized brand. The redesign simplified the interface, improved navigation, and introduced motion to create a more intuitive, polished experience.

As a Principal Designer, I contributed across key parts of the redesign. I designed layouts for multiple screens and helped define the visual hierarchy for core UI components including the menu, calendar, and selectors. I also supported the evolution of the design system and overall product vision, and developed motion design patterns to bring consistency and clarity to interactions throughout the app.
